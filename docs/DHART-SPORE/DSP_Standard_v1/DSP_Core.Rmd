## Data Sharing Plan

To help data sharing logistics, please complete the information requested below about the data to be shared.
The elements of the data-sharing plan are as follows:

- **What**: the nature of the data being shared and how they relate to your overall project, including ‘data type’, ‘assay’ and ‘species’, which are controlled vocabulary terms described here.

- **How much**: how many samples are you measuring? Samples can be considered aliquots/specimens for which you are running a single experiment. If you have multiple experiments, then each gets a separate row in the table below. In the case of single-cell assays, each cell is considered to be a sample.

- **When**: when the data will be uploaded to the embargoed data platform space.
